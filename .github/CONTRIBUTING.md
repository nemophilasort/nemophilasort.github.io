# Welcome

First off, thank you for considering contributing to NEMOPHILA Song Sorter.

This is a fork of [Sakura Sort](https://github.com/sakurasort/sakurasort.github.io). Thanks to the contributors there for providing this for us to use.

This repo uses the discography found on the [NEMOPHILA Discography page](https://nemophila.tokyo/en/discography/) and in the NEMOPHILA Discord server.

Join the [Contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/nemophilasort/teams/contributors) to get started.

# Ground Rules

* Only add NEMOPHILA songs to the song list when adding songs.
* Create an appropriate category when adding new albums or singles.
* Create issues or discussions for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Contribute back to Sakura Sort if you come up with something useful for the community.
* Be nice.
